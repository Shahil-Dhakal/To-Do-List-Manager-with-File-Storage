INTRODUCTION:
    This project is basically, a small to-do manager, done in python using simple logic and python programming. User can add, delete, mark the tasks, etc. Its completely done using pure python without any framework, for the purpose of logic building.

    I will be using Incremental model to do this project. I will assume the time frame to be 1 week. Right now, I have no idea how much increment would it take but let's assume it would be completed after 7 increment. The last increment, obviously would be about testing and debugging the whole system, refining and improving by handling edge cases.

1st INCREMENT:
    In the first increment, I have made a menu where the action that the user can perform would be shown. I have used simple function to print all those menus and incase of wrong input by user, I have handled it by using else case and re-calling the function in else block for asking valid input to the user.

    A little update in the code is done to write a clear and good code. For example, displaying menu is inserted in a function and taking user input is also done through function. Used while loop to run the code untill the use chooses to exit.

2nd INCREMENT:
